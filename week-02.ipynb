    "I'm sure all of you know that the Puffin presents a remarkable combination of elegance and cuteness that is unparalleled in the animal kingdom. What you may not know is that [the Puffin is endangered](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/29/climate/puffins-dwindling-iceland.html). In fact, [global populations have plummeted in recent years](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/uncertain-future-puffin-dinner-180961829/) due to several factors such as climate change and hunting (not helped by that the Puffins are, allegedly, delicious). The first step to finding a solution is to understand the problem. Hence, for this assignment we're going to build a system for simulating the Puffin population. We're going to do this for an imaginary population and we'll make some simplifying assumptions but the general idea is applicable to many real-world scenarios."

    "## Getting Ahead\n",
    "Congratulations on completing the assignment! Nice work :)\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will ultimately do little to alleviate the problems the Puffins of today face. However, while we've made several simplifying assumptions the general method used above is applicable to a wide range of scenarios in the real world. Scientists and decision makers rely on models not unlike this one in every field imaginable. The beauty of programming (and Python is an especially good example) is that it gives you access to the tools you need to reason about the world. Even a simple program like this can offer a surprising amount of insight into complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the shortcomings of our system is that it only simulates a single year. To design policy we need to simulate the population over many years. Hence, for the getting ahead part we're goubg to write a new function `nsimulate(years, nage0, nage1, nage2, nadults)` that simulautes `years` years of the population and returns the number of adult Puffins at the end of this period. The function should take as arguments the number of years to simulate and the number of Puffins at the start of the first year. Each year should behave like in `simulate2` that we wrote for problem 7. To do this you'll need to [learn about for loops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LgyKiq_hU0). Remember that you need to update the number of Puffins of each age for each cycle of the simulation. Assume that each adult Puffin (as counted by the end of the year, i.e., after the death rate and hunting quota has been subtracted and after `nage2` has been added to `nadults`) has 0.4 chicks in each year, i.e., `nage0` for the next year is computed as `nage0 = nadults * 0.4`, where `nadults` is the number of adults at the end of the current year.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part is meant as preparation for the coming course material and includes materiel not yet covered in the course. Then again, you never have to catch up if you're always getting ahead."

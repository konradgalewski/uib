    "# Assignment Week 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the third weekly assignment! Every week we'll give you an assignment that covers the materiel from the previous week. Again, these assignment are not obligatory but are highly recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've landed a job at the [Lon Lon Ranch](http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Lon_Lon_Ranch). The ranch stock a wide range of items and it's your job to keep track of what it's all worth. Specifically, you've been tasked with writing a function that given an item name, its age and (optionally) further information returns the value of the item. Items (such as milk) may change in value over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment differs from the previous one in that you'll be working on the same function throughout the whole assignment. Initially the function will be short. However, as more items and rules are added you'll need to add more things to the function. Keep in mind that adding additional functions that are called from the main function is a good strategy to keep each function simple and easy to reason about. Furthermore, you'll need to take some care to figure out what's wrong when the tests don't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Guidelines\n",
    "These are general guidelines that will (hopefully) help you preserve your sanity through your programming endeavours.\n",
    "* Set aside time to clean up your code. The number that gets bandied around on the internet is that the best programmers spend roughly half their time cleaning up and rewriting their code, i.e., you are halfway done when you get it working.\n",
    "* The sooner you start programming the longer it takes, i.e., make sure you understand the problem and have an idea for how to solve it before you get started.\n",
    "* Make sure you understand the current assignment before moving on. Building on bedrock is better than building on sand.\n",
    "* You should be spending a significant amount of time on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [Google](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=how+to+python). Even experienced programmers do this.\n",
    "* [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is the official Python style guilde. Following these guidelines makes sure your code is neat and easy to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function\n",
    "You'll be working in the code cell below throughout the whole assignment. As we're adding more items and rules you should make modifications as needed to this function. **Make sure to re-run the whole notebook by pressing the double play button at the top (restart the kernel, then re-run the whole notebook) whenever you make any changes.** This is due to two reasons:\n",
    "* You need to rerun a cell with code in it whenever you make changes for the changes to take effect.\n",
    "* You should re-run all tests whenever you change something to make sure your change didn't break an earlier test.\n",
    "Re-running the whole notebook takes care of this automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_signature) of the function you'll be working on is `get_value(item_name, item_age, item_details)`. The parameters are:\n",
    "* item_name: A string containing the item name, e.g., \"milk\".\n",
    "* item_age: The age of the item measured in days.\n",
    "* item_details: A string containing further details about the item, e.g., \"lon lon\". For items with no details this argument should be the empty string (`\"\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "When learning programming as you do now it's common to look back on the code written by past you and wonder what in the world he/she was thinking. This is good because it means present you is a stronger programmer than past you. However, it also means present you has to keep correcting the things past you wrote. Therefore, it's important that you go back and clean up your code after completing each problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Tip: Functions, Parameters, Arguments and Return Values\n",
    "Remember that when a function is called (e.g., `get_value(\"milk\", 2*7, \"\")`) the *actual argument* values are computed and placed in the *formal parameter* variables (e.g., `item_name = 'milk'`, `item_age = 14`, `item_details = ''`). When the function reaches the `return` statement, the *return value* is computed and becomes the value of the function call."

Quality is expressed as a [floating point number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic) ([`float`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex)) between 0 and 1 (inclusive).

    "* The value of the whisky remains constant between 30 day increments, i.e., you need to round down to the closest multiple of 30 days.\n",
    "* The overall value of the whisky should be multiplied by the quality, which is greater than 0 and at most 1.\n",

Python won't let you treat strings like numbers, even if the text within them happen to look like numbers.

    "## Getting Ahead\n",
    "This week we've focused on separating functionality and debugging. I'm sure you've experienced that it's not always easy to figure out what's wrong when you're dealing with lots of different cases like we've done here. Congratulations on completing it!\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a very natural extension we can make to the code you've written. The function we've written takes arguments for a single item at a time. However, the ranch frequently processes long lists of items at a time. Write a new function `get_values(item_list)` that takes as its single argument [a list](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists) of lists. Each of the lists in the list contains the three fields `\"item_name\"`, `\"item_age\"` and `item_description\"` at indices 0, 1 and 2, respectively. You should call the `get_value` function you've written for each element of `item_list`. To do this you need to learn about lists. I recommend looking at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohCDWZgNIU0). The style is a bit cheesy but the content is good. If you're using list comprehensions you can do this in a single line of code. Using `append()` is also fine and only requires a little bit more code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part is meant as preparation for the coming course material and includes materiel not yet covered in the course. Then again, you never have to catch up if you're always getting ahead. This part requires doing more learning on your own. You're in very good shape if you can complete it :)"
